This is a simple card which i made years ago while learning it is made without javascript with html & css only ,
i am uploading this only for the beginner students to practice the design , building these kind of designs really helps with understanding css and html flow
maybe this is not the most effective way to build this but its the part of learning process so enjoy!
!!only reason to upload this repo is from where i have started .
have faith and you will get better with time..
